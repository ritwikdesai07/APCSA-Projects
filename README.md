# APCSA-Projects

This repository contains all the projects I completed during my AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course in high school. Each project is written in Java and demonstrates my understanding of key programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Introduction

During my AP Computer Science A course, I worked on several projects to apply and reinforce my understanding of core programming concepts. These projects range from simple applications to more complex systems, and each one has allowed me to enhance my skills in Java programming.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects completed in the course:

1. **Project 1: Blackjack**
   - **Description**: A simulation of the card game "Blackjack." This project implements the game rules, including dealing cards to the player and dealer, determining the winner based on hand values, and handling cases such as "bust" and "blackjack."
   - **Concepts Covered**: Object-oriented programming, random number generation, loops, and conditional logic.
   - **Instructions**: To run the game, execute the `Blackjack.java` class.

2. **Project 2: Card Runner**
   - **Description**: This project contains the foundation for the games "Blackjack" and "War." It handles the basic operations of a deck of cards, such as shuffling, dealing, and managing the cards during gameplay.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Data structures (arrays or lists), random number generation, and basic game logic.
   - **Instructions**: To use the `CardRunner` class for Blackjack or War, run the `CardRunner.java` file.

3. **Project 3: Pet (The Hare vs. The Tortoise)**
   - **Description**: This project simulates the classic fable of the tortoise and the hare. The hare has a random jump mechanic, and using inheritance, we demonstrate that the hare will win most of the time against the tortoise when the hareâ€™s jumps are randomized.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Inheritance, random number generation, object-oriented programming principles.
   - **Instructions**: Run the `Pet.java` file to see the simulation.

4. **Project 4: Wordle (Located in the Strings Folder)**
   - **Description**: A miniature version of the popular word game "Wordle." The user is prompted to guess a five-letter word within a set number of attempts. After each guess, the system provides feedback on which letters are correct and in the right position.
   - **Concepts Covered**: String manipulation, loops, arrays, and input validation.
   - **Instructions**: Navigate to the Strings folder and run the `Wordle.java` file.

5. **Project 5: Supers**
   - **Description**: A game where random characters are generated with random occupations. The characters are placed into two groups: heroes and villains. The villain moves around, turning adjacent characters evil, while the hero tries to save as many characters as possible by keeping adjacent people safe. At the end of the game, the hero and villain fight to determine who prevails.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Random number generation, arrays or lists, game logic, and object-oriented design.
   - **Instructions**: Run the `Supers.java` file to start the game.

6. **Project 6: War**
   - **Description**: A card game where two players compete by revealing the highest card. If there is a tie, both players place three cards down and flip the fourth to determine the winner. The game continues until one player has all the cards.
   - **Concepts Covered**: Card game mechanics, random number generation, loops, and game logic.
   - **Instructions**: Run the `War.java` file to play the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - All projects are implemented using the Java programming language.
- **IDE** - IntelliJ IDEA, TextPad (On school computers), VSCode
